# Architecture Documentation

This folder contains the core architectural decisions and design documents for the Test Management Platform.

## üìã Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Test Code and Metadata Separation
- **[ADR-001-test-code-separation.md](ADR-001-test-code-separation.md)** - Core architectural decision defining the separation between test code and metadata
- **[ADR-001-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md](ADR-001-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md)** - Complete implementation plan for ADR-001 (comprehensive multi-platform approach)
- **[ADR-001-MVP-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md](ADR-001-MVP-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md)** - MVP-focused implementation plan (JIRA-Azure DevOps integration)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The Test Management Platform is built on the foundation of **ADR-001: Test Code and Metadata Separation**, which establishes:

1. **Clean Separation**: Test execution code remains in CI/CD platforms while metadata is centrally managed
2. **Universal Correlation**: Platform-agnostic test identification and correlation system
3. **Extensible Integration**: Standardized interfaces for adding new platform integrations
4. **Centralized Intelligence**: Test analytics, trend analysis, and failure management in one place

## üìä Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Infrastructure ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Git integration services
- Test discovery and identification
- Database schema design
- Core correlation utilities

### Phase 2: MVP Implementation üöß IN PROGRESS
- Enhanced Azure DevOps integration
- JIRA-ADO workflow automation
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Configuration management interface

### Future Phases: Platform Expansion
- GitHub Actions integration
- GitLab CI support
- Advanced analytics and AI features
- Enterprise capabilities

## üéØ Key Architectural Principles

1. **Platform Agnostic**: Core services work with any CI/CD platform
2. **Metadata Driven**: Rich test metadata enables intelligent automation
3. **Real-time Processing**: Event-driven architecture for immediate response
4. **Extensible Design**: Plugin architecture for easy platform additions
5. **Developer-Centric**: Minimal workflow disruption, maximum value

## üìñ Document Guide

### For Architects
- Start with **ADR-001-test-code-separation.md** for core architectural principles
- Review **ADR-001-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** for comprehensive technical design
- Check **ADR-001-MVP-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** for current implementation focus

### For Developers
- Focus on **ADR-001-MVP-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** for immediate development tasks
- Reference core ADR for architectural constraints and patterns
- Use implementation plans for detailed technical specifications

### For Product Managers
- **ADR-001-MVP-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** provides feature specifications and success criteria
- Core ADR explains the platform's technical foundation and capabilities
- Implementation plans show development timeline and deliverables
