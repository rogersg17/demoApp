# ADR-001: Test Code and Metadata Separation

## Status
**Accepted** - August 3, 2025

## Context

As the Demo Application evolves into a comprehensive Test Management Platform, we need to establish clear architectural boundaries between test execution logic and test management concerns. The system integrates with multiple CI/CD platforms (JIRA, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) and needs to maintain a clear separation of responsibilities.

### Current Challenges
- Mixed concerns between test execution and test management
- Difficulty in maintaining test metadata across different execution environments
- Complex synchronization between test code changes and test management state
- Unclear ownership boundaries between development teams and test management systems

### System Requirements
- Support for multiple CI/CD platforms and execution environments
- Real-time monitoring and reporting of test execution across platforms
- Centralized test metadata management while preserving development workflow
- Scalable architecture that can handle enterprise-level test suites

## Decision

**Test code lives in Git. Test metadata and state live in the Test Management System (TMS). The TMS acts as the observer and orchestrator, not the executor of code logic.**

### Detailed Architecture Principles

#### 1. **Test Code Responsibility** (Git Repository)
- **Source of Truth**: All test implementation, logic, and execution instructions
- **Ownership**: Development teams own test code as part of their codebase
- **Lifecycle**: Follows standard software development lifecycle (branching, merging, versioning)
- **Content**:
  - Test implementation files (`.spec.ts`, `.test.js`, etc.)
  - Test configuration files (Playwright config, Jest config, etc.)
  - Test data and fixtures
  - CI/CD pipeline definitions

#### 2. **Test Metadata and State Responsibility** (TMS)
- **Source of Truth**: Test execution history, results, analytics, and organizational metadata
- **Ownership**: TMS manages test lifecycle metadata and cross-platform orchestration
- **Lifecycle**: Continuous collection and analysis of test execution data
- **Content**:
  - Test execution results and history
  - Test case metadata (tags, priorities, ownership)
  - Execution analytics and trends
  - Flaky test detection and classification
  - Cross-platform execution coordination

#### 3. **TMS as Observer and Orchestrator**
- **Observer Role**: 
  - Monitors test execution across all integrated platforms
  - Collects results, metrics, and performance data
  - Tracks test lifecycle events (created, modified, executed, failed)
- **Orchestrator Role**:
  - Coordinates test execution across multiple environments
  - Manages test scheduling and prioritization
  - Provides unified reporting and analytics
  - Facilitates cross-team collaboration and visibility

## Consequences

### Positive
✅ **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Test logic remains with developers, metadata with TMS
✅ **Platform Agnostic**: TMS can integrate with any CI/CD platform without affecting test code
✅ **Developer Workflow Preservation**: Teams continue using familiar Git-based workflows
✅ **Centralized Intelligence**: Unified view of test health across all platforms and teams
✅ **Scalability**: Independent scaling of test execution and test management concerns
✅ **Flexibility**: Easy to change execution platforms without losing historical data
✅ **Version Control**: Test code benefits from full Git capabilities (branching, merging, history)

### Negative
⚠️ **Synchronization Complexity**: Need robust mechanisms to keep test code and metadata in sync
⚠️ **Additional Infrastructure**: Requires reliable communication channels between Git and TMS
⚠️ **Potential Data Consistency Issues**: Risk of test code and metadata becoming out of sync
⚠️ **Integration Overhead**: Each new platform requires integration development
⚠️ **Dependency Management**: TMS depends on external systems for complete functionality

### Neutral
📋 **Documentation Overhead**: Need clear guidelines for test metadata management
📋 **Training Requirements**: Teams need to understand the separation model
📋 **Monitoring Needs**: Require robust monitoring of integration points

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. **Git Integration Patterns**
```
Repository Structure:
├── tests/
│   ├── e2e/           # End-to-end test implementations
│   ├── integration/   # Integration test implementations
│   └── unit/          # Unit test implementations
├── .tms/
│   ├── metadata.json  # TMS-specific metadata (optional)
│   └── config.yaml    # TMS integration configuration
└── playwright.config.ts  # Test execution configuration
```

### 2. **TMS Integration Points**
- **Webhook Endpoints**: Receive test execution events from CI/CD platforms
- **Git Webhooks**: Monitor test code changes and updates
- **API Integrations**: Pull test results from platform APIs
- **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket connections for live test execution tracking

### 3. **Data Flow Architecture**
```
Git Repository (Test Code) ←→ CI/CD Platform ←→ TMS (Metadata & Results)
                ↑                    ↓
        Developer Workflow    Test Execution & Results Collection
```

### 4. **Synchronization Mechanisms**
- **Test Discovery**: TMS discovers tests by scanning repository structure
- **Result Correlation**: Match execution results to test code using unique identifiers
- **Metadata Enrichment**: TMS adds analytics and organizational metadata to test results
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Changes in TMS metadata can trigger Git repository updates (via PRs)

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: **Monolithic Test Management**
- **Description**: Store both test code and metadata in TMS
- **Rejected Because**: 
  - Breaks developer workflows
  - Creates vendor lock-in
  - Difficult to version control test logic
  - Limits CI/CD platform flexibility

### Alternative 2: **Git-Only Approach**
- **Description**: Store all test metadata as files in Git repository
- **Rejected Because**:
  - Git not optimized for time-series data and analytics
  - Difficult to provide real-time insights
  - Scaling issues with large execution history
  - Complex cross-repository analytics

### Alternative 3: **Hybrid Storage Model**
- **Description**: Some metadata in Git, some in TMS
- **Rejected Because**:
  - Unclear ownership boundaries
  - Synchronization complexity
  - Developer confusion about source of truth
