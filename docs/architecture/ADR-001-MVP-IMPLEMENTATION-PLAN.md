## MVP Feature Specifications

### Priority 1: Core Integration Features

#### Azure DevOps Pipeline Monitoring
```javascript
// MVP ADO Integration Service
class MVPADOIntegrationService {
  async configurePipeline(config) {
    // Configure specific build definition for monitoring
    // Store configuration in mvp_pipeline_configs
    // Start real-time monitoring
  }

  async processBuildCompletion(buildResult) {
    // Process completed build results
    // Extract test failures
    // Trigger JIRA workflow if failures detected
  }

  async getTestResults(buildId) {
    // Fetch test results from ADO API
    // Parse failures and extract context
    // Return structured failure data
  }
}
```

#### JIRA-ADO Bridge Service
```javascript
// MVP JIRA-ADO Bridge
class MVPJiraADOBridge {
  async processTestFailure(failureData) {
    // Check for existing JIRA issue
    // Create new issue or update existing
    // Include ADO context and links
    // Track correlation in database
  }

  async enrichJiraIssue(issueData, adoContext) {
    // Add ADO-specific fields to JIRA issue
    // Include pipeline information
    // Attach relevant artifacts
    // Set appropriate labels and components
  }
}
