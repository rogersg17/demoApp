# Test Management Platform - Future Development Plan
*Last Updated: August 4, 2025*

## 🎯 Current Status

**MVP Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for production deployment  
**Architecture Status**: ✅ OBSERVER/ORCHESTRATOR PATTERN IMPLEMENTED  
**CI/CD Integration**: ✅ COMPLETE - Comprehensive template library implemented  
**Enhanced Orchestration**: ✅ COMPLETE - Advanced scheduling, load balancing, and monitoring  
**Next Priority**: GitHub Actions integration and technology modernization

**🎉 Major Achievement**: Successfully transformed from executor to observer/orchestrator pattern!

### ✅ **Architecture Transformation Complete (Week 9)**

**Before**: Direct test execution with `spawn('npx', ['playwright', 'test', ...])`  
**After**: External CI/CD coordination with webhook-based result collection

#### **Implemented Components**:
- **TestExecutionQueue Service**: Queue management with multi-provider support (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins)

- **Updated API Endpoints**: `/api/tests/run` now orchestrates rather than executes
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live orchestration monitoring
- **Health Monitoring**: Webhook health endpoints and queue status monitoring

#### **New API Endpoints Available**:
- `POST /api/tests/run` - Orchestrate test execution (✅ Updated)
- `GET /api/tests/results/:executionId` - Get execution status
- `GET /api/tests/queue/status` - View queue status  
- `POST /api/tests/cancel/:executionId` - Cancel execution
- `GET /api/tests/history` - Get execution history
- `POST /api/webhooks/test-results` - Generic webhook for results
- `POST /api/webhooks/github-actions` - GitHub Actions specific
- `POST /api/webhooks/azure-devops` - Azure DevOps specific
- `POST /api/webhooks/jenkins` - Jenkins specific
- `GET /api/webhooks/health` - Health check (✅ Verified working)
