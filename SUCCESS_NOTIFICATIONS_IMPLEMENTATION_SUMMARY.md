## ðŸ“‹ Success Notification Types

### 1. Save Operations
```typescript
// Settings saved successfully
{
  message: "Settings saved successfully!",
  type: "save",
  operation: "save-settings",
  details: "Settings synchronized with server and saved locally",
  hideDelay: 4000
}
```

### 2. Load Operations
```typescript
// Server load success
{
  message: "Settings loaded from server",
  type: "load", 
  operation: "load-settings",
  details: "All settings have been synchronized from the server",
  hideDelay: 3000
}

// Local fallback success
{
  message: "Settings loaded from local storage",
  type: "load",
  operation: "load-settings", 
  details: "Server unavailable, using cached settings",
  hideDelay: 3000
}
```

### 3. Connection Tests
```typescript
// Service connection success
{
  message: "GitHub connection test successful",
  type: "connection",
  operation: "test-connection-github",
  details: "Successfully connected to GitHub service",
  hideDelay: 5000
}
```

### 4. Reset Operations
```typescript
// Settings reset success
{
  message: "Settings reset to defaults",
  type: "reset",
  operation: "reset-settings", 
  details: "All configuration has been restored to factory defaults",
  hideDelay: 4000
