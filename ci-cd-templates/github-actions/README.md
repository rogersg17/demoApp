# GitHub Actions Integration for TMS

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflow templates for integrating with the Test Management System (TMS) using the Observer/Orchestrator pattern.

## Files

- `test-execution.yml` - Main workflow template for running tests and reporting results back to TMS

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

```
TMS_WEBHOOK_TOKEN - Authentication token for TMS webhook endpoints
```

### 2. Workflow Integration

#### Option A: Manual Workflow Dispatch

1. Copy `test-execution.yml` to `.github/workflows/` in your repository
2. Go to Actions tab â†’ Select "Test Execution for TMS" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" and provide:
   - Test suite (all, smoke, regression, api, ui)
   - TMS Execution ID (from TMS dashboard)
   - Webhook URL (your TMS instance webhook endpoint)
   - Environment (staging, production, dev)

#### Option B: Repository Dispatch (Automated)

The workflow can be triggered programmatically via TMS:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.github.com/repos/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO/dispatches \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  -d '{
    "event_type": "run-tests",
    "client_payload": {
      "execution_id": "exec-123",
      "webhook_url": "https://your-tms.com/api/webhooks/github-actions",
      "test_suite": "smoke",
      "environment": "staging"
    }
  }'
```

## Workflow Features

### Test Execution
- **Parallel Sharding**: Tests run across 4 parallel shards for faster execution
- **Test Suite Selection**: Support for different test suites (smoke, regression, api, ui)
- **Environment Configuration**: Configurable test environments
- **Matrix Strategy**: Parallel execution with result aggregation

### Result Reporting
- **Real-time Updates**: Webhook notifications at start, shard completion, and final results
- **Detailed Metrics**: Total, passed, failed, and skipped test counts
- **Failed Test Details**: Specific information about failed tests
- **Artifact Storage**: Test results, reports, and logs stored as GitHub artifacts

### Integration Points
- **TMS Webhook Integration**: Automatic result posting to TMS webhooks
- **PR Comments**: Automatic test result comments on pull requests
- **Artifact Collection**: Playwright reports and test results preserved

## Webhook Payload Format

The workflow sends webhook payloads in this format:

  }
}
```

## Customization

### Test Commands
Modify the test execution step to match your test framework:

```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    case "${{ env.TEST_SUITE }}" in
      "smoke")
        TEST_CMD="npm run test:smoke"
        ;;
      "regression")
        TEST_CMD="npm run test:regression"
        ;;
      *)
        TEST_CMD="npm test"
        ;;
    esac
```

### Result Parsing
Adjust result parsing based on your test output format:

```yaml
- name: Parse test results
  run: |
    # For Jest results
    TOTAL=$(jq '.numTotalTests' jest-results.json)
    PASSED=$(jq '.numPassedTests' jest-results.json)
    FAILED=$(jq '.numFailedTests' jest-results.json)
```

### Sharding
Modify the matrix strategy for different parallel execution needs:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    shard: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  # Increase for more parallelism
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook Authentication Failures**
   - Verify `TMS_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` secret is set correctly
   - Check TMS webhook endpoint authentication requirements

2. **Test Result Parsing Errors**
   - Ensure test output format matches parsing logic
   - Check that test results file is generated correctly

3. **Shard Aggregation Issues**
   - Verify all shards complete successfully
   - Check artifact upload/download steps

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding:

```yaml
env:
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```

## Integration with TMS

This workflow integrates with the TMS Observer/Orchestrator architecture:

1. **TMS Request**: User initiates test run from TMS dashboard
2. **GitHub Trigger**: TMS triggers workflow via repository dispatch
3. **Test Execution**: GitHub Actions runs tests in parallel shards
4. **Result Collection**: Webhook notifications sent to TMS
5. **Dashboard Update**: TMS updates dashboard with real-time results

The workflow supports the TMS webhook endpoints:
- `/api/webhooks/github-actions` - GitHub Actions specific webhook
- `/api/webhooks/test-results` - Generic test results webhook
