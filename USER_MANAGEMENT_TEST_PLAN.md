## 🚀 Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Playwright installed (`npm install @playwright/test`)
- Chrome browser available on the system

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Run all user management tests in Chrome (headless)
npm run test:user-management

# Run all user management tests in Chrome (headed - visible browser)
npm run test:user-management:headed

# Run all Chrome-specific tests
npm run test:chrome

# Run Chrome tests with UI mode (interactive)
npm run test:chrome:ui

# View test reports
npm run test:report
```

### Configuration Files

- **`playwright.config.ts`** - Main TypeScript configuration with Chrome project
- **`tsconfig.json`** - TypeScript compiler configuration
- **`tests/user-management.spec.ts`** - Main test file (TypeScript)
- **`package.json`** - Test scripts and dependencies

## 🔧 Test Configuration

### Chrome Browser Settings
- **Project**: chromium (using main config)
- **Viewport**: 1280x720 (desktop view)
- **JavaScript**: Enabled
- **Screenshots**: Captured on failure
- **Videos**: Recorded on failure
- **Traces**: Collected on retry

### Server Configuration
- **Express Server**: Automatically started before tests
- **Port**: 3000
- **Base URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Timeout**: 2 minutes for server startup

## 📋 Test Scenarios Covered

### 1. User Addition Workflow
```typescript
// Example test flow:
1. Navigate to User Management page
2. Click "Add User" button
3. Fill form with valid data:
   - First Name: "Test"
   - Last Name: "User"
   - Email: "test.user@example.com"
   - Role: "User"
   - Department: "QA"
4. Submit form
5. Verify success message
6. Verify user appears in table
7. Verify statistics updated
```

### 2. User Deletion Workflow
```typescript
// Example test flow:
1. Identify user to delete
2. Click delete button for user
3. Verify confirmation dialog appears
4. Confirm deletion
5. Verify success message
6. Verify user removed from table
7. Verify statistics updated
```

### 3. Filtering and Search
```typescript
// Example test flow:
1. Apply status filter (Active/Pending/Inactive)
2. Verify only matching users shown
3. Apply role filter (Admin/User/Moderator)
4. Verify filtering works correctly
5. Use search functionality
6. Verify search results are accurate
```

## 🛡️ Error Handling Tests

### Validation Tests
- **Required Fields**: Ensures all required fields are validated
- **Email Format**: Tests email format validation
- **Duplicate Emails**: Prevents duplicate email addresses
- **Role Selection**: Validates role selection requirements

### Network Error Tests
- **Server Unavailable**: Tests behavior when server is down
- **Slow Network**: Tests timeout handling
- **Interrupted Requests**: Tests handling of network interruptions

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance Metrics
- **Page Load Time**: < 5 seconds
- **Filter Operations**: < 2 seconds
- **Form Submission**: < 3 seconds
- **User Addition**: < 5 seconds
- **User Deletion**: < 3 seconds

## 🧩 Test Data Management

### Test Users
The tests create and clean up test users as needed:
- **Test User**: Created and deleted during tests
- **Rapid Users**: Multiple users for performance testing
- **Role-specific Users**: Users with different roles for filtering tests

### Data Cleanup
- Tests clean up after themselves
- No persistent test data remains
- Database state is restored after each test run

## 🔍 Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Server Not Starting**: Check if port 3000 is already in use
2. **Tests Timing Out**: Increase timeout values in config
3. **Element Not Found**: Check if selectors match current UI
4. **Network Issues**: Verify server is running and accessible

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Run with debug output
DEBUG=playwright:* npm run test:user-management

# Run specific test with debug
npm run test:user-management:headed -- --grep "should successfully add a new user"

# Generate trace for failed tests
npm run test:user-management -- --trace on
```

### Log Files
- **Test Results**: `playwright-report/index.html`
- **Screenshots**: `test-results/` directory
- **Videos**: `test-results/` directory (on failure)
- **Traces**: `test-results/` directory (on retry)

## 📈 Continuous Integration
