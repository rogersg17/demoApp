# Test Management Platform - Production Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Requirements
- [ ] Docker and Docker Compose installed on production server
- [ ] SSL certificates obtained and configured (optional for initial deployment)
- [ ] Production environment variables configured
- [ ] Database backup procedures tested
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting systems ready

### Deployment Steps

#### 1. Server Preparation
```bash
# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker and Docker Compose
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y

# Create deployment directory
sudo mkdir -p /opt/tms-mvp
sudo chown $USER:$USER /opt/tms-mvp
```

#### 2. Application Deployment
```bash
# Clone or copy application files
cd /opt/tms-mvp
git clone <repository-url> .

# Navigate to deployment directory
cd deployment

# Review and update production.env file
cp production.env.example production.env
nano production.env

# Build and start services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify deployment
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f tms-app
```

#### 3. Database Migration
```bash
# Run database migration
docker-compose exec tms-app ./deployment/migrate-database.sh

# Verify database
docker-compose exec tms-app sqlite3 /app/data/app.db ".tables"
```

#### 4. Health Verification
```bash
# Check application health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Check all services
docker-compose ps
```

### Post-Deployment Configuration

#### JIRA Integration Setup
1. Log into the TMS dashboard at `http://your-server/`
2. Navigate to Configuration â†’ JIRA Settings
3. Enter JIRA server URL and authentication credentials
4. Test connection and save configuration

#### Azure DevOps Integration Setup
1. Navigate to Configuration â†’ Azure DevOps Settings
2. Enter ADO organization URL and personal access token
3. Select projects and build definitions to monitor
4. Configure pipeline monitoring settings

#### Pipeline Configuration
1. Go to Dashboard â†’ Add Pipeline
2. Select ADO organization and project
3. Choose build definitions to monitor
4. Configure failure notification rules
5. Set JIRA project for issue creation

### Monitoring and Maintenance

#### Health Checks
- Application health: `http://your-server/api/health`
- Database integrity: Run weekly integrity checks
- Log monitoring: Check `/app/logs/tms.log` for errors

#### Backup Procedures
- Database: Automated daily backups to `/app/backups/`
- Configuration: Backup `production.env` and custom settings
- Application: Version control for code changes

#### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor response times via `/api/health` endpoint
- Check resource usage: `docker stats`
- Review logs for errors and warnings

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues
1. **Application won't start**: Check environment variables and Docker logs
2. **Database connection errors**: Verify database migration completed
3. **JIRA/ADO connectivity**: Test API credentials and network access
4. **WebSocket issues**: Check reverse proxy configuration

#### Support Resources
- Application logs: `docker-compose logs tms-app`
- System logs: `journalctl -u docker`
- Health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/health`

### Security Considerations

#### Production Security
- [ ] Change default session secret in production.env
- [ ] Configure CORS origins for production domain
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up firewall rules for required ports only
- [ ] Regular security updates for base images

#### Access Control
- [ ] Limit SSH access to production server
- [ ] Use secure passwords for all accounts
- [ ] Implement backup encryption
- [ ] Regular security audits

### Rollback Procedures

#### Emergency Rollback
```bash
# Stop current deployment
docker-compose down

# Restore previous version
git checkout <previous-stable-tag>
docker-compose up -d

# Restore database if needed
cp /app/backups/app_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.db /app/data/app.db
```

### Support and Maintenance

#### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Weekly: Review logs and performance metrics
- Monthly: Update dependencies and security patches
- Quarterly: Full system backup and disaster recovery test
